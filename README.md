## About

## Process

When starting BiosSledgehammer.ps1, the following will happen:

* A log files ``BiosSledgehammer.ps1.log-XX.txt`` is created, where XX is a sequentially increased with each run.
* It checks if the environment is ready (64-bit OS, required folders found, device is from HP etc.)
* A check is made if communication between BCU (BiosConfigUtility64.exe) and the BIOS through WMI is possible by reading the value of *Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)*
* It tries to figure out the password the device is using by going through all files in the [PwdFiles](#pwdfilesfolder) folder and trying to change the value of *Asset Tracking Number* to a random value (it will be reverted to the original value at the end). An empty password is already tried first. 
* A search is performed below the [Models](#modelsfolder) folder to locate the matching folder for the current model (this is a partial search, so a sub folder named *1040 G1* will match the model *HP EliteBook Folio 1040 G1*)
* If a file called **BIOS-Update.txt** is found, it is read and checked if a BIOS update is required. If so, the BIOS update files are locally copied and the update is performed. Any **.log* file generated by the update tool is attached to the BIOS Sledgehammer log file.  Finally, a restart is requested because the actual update is performed during POST. See [BIOS Update](#biosupdate) for more details.
* If a file called **TPM-Update.txt** exists, it is read and checked if a TPM update is required. This is done by checking if the TPM Specification version (1.2 or 2.0) or the TPM firmware are below the configured versions. If so, the TPM updates files are locally copied and executed. Any **.log* file generated by the update tool is attached to the BIOS Sledgehammer log file.  Finally, a restart is requested because the actual update is performed during POST. See [TPM Update](#tpmupdate) for more details.
* If a file called **BIOS-Password.txt** is found, it is checked if the device is already set to use this password. The password is not specified directly (clear), but using a *.bin file name that stores the password encrypted. If the passwords differ, the configured *.bin file is read from the [PwdFiles folder](#pwdfilesfolder) and the password is changed. 
* If a file called **BIOS-Settings.txt** exists, it is read and each entry is the name of a BIOS setting that needs to be changed. Each entry will be performed as single change (not all in a batch) to detect faulty settings more easily. See [BIOS Settings](#biossettings) for more details.

## Configuration files format

BIOS Sledgehammer uses several configuration files that all follow the same ``NAME==VALUE`` syntax. There are saved as *.txt files to make it easier to change them directly with a text editor. 

```
# This is a comment and ignored
; So is this line. 
#And this.
;And this also.

# The general format is NAME==VALUE
Version==1.08

# Leading or trailing white spaces are ignored so this is the same as the line before
 Version == 1.08
```

## <a name="#pwdfilesfolder">*PwdFile* folder</a>

The ``\PwdFiles`` folder stores all passowrds BIOS Sledgehammer should try and also the order in which they are processed. 

The order it uses is determined by simply sorting the files


## <a name="#modelsfolder">*Models* folder</a>

It is expected that each model (type) of hardware you want to support, requires a separate sub folder below ``\Models``. The model (type) is displayed automatically by BIOS Sledgehammer, so simply run it once for each hardware to know the model for it. 

The sub folder will contain all settings files together with the source files for any updates. Please note that BIOS Sledgehammer does not support “sharing” update files between several models, each model requires its own set of files. That’s because sharing files between models has proven to cause problems for older models each time the shared folders are updated for new models. 

To locate the model folder, a partial search with the current model is used. If you execute it on a *HP EliteBook Folio 1040 G1*, the folder can be called exactly like that, or, if you are lazy, also *1040 G1”. 

If you do not want to change anything for a given model, simply create an empty folder. If no model folder at all is found, an error is generated.

## Using from MDT or SCCM

By default, MDT will run all scripts hidden in order to hide any sensitive information displayed. If you are okay with that, just run ``BiosSledgehammer.ps1`` as PowerShell scripts but remember to tick the box for "Disable 64bit file system redirection" so it is run as 64-bit PowerShell process (this settings is only for SCCM - MDT always runs PowerShell native).

If you want to see what BIOS Sledgehammer is doing, run the provided batch file ``RunVisble.bat`` from MDT with this command line: ``cmd.exe /c "%SCRIPTROOT%\BiosSledgehammer\RunVisible.bat"`` (given you stored it in the *\Scripts* folder). 

This batch automatically uses the correct version of PowerShell, so no box to check for this. It will also set the ``-WaitAtEnd`` parameter which causes BIOS Sledgehammer to pause for 30 seconds when finished so you can have a quick look at the results.

## TODO
* In case BCU returns the code 32769 it can mean two things:
  * This setting can not be set without a BIOS password beeing in place (TPM Activation Policy for example)
  * This setting would result in damage to the current systen (Secure Boot enabled when running this script from Windows 7)
* BIOS passwords need to meet minimum complexity rules. If the password stored in a *.bin file does not meet this rules, the password change will fail. Make sure your password contains uppercase and lowercase letter, together with at least one number.
*  #HPBiosUpdRec64.exe might restart itself as a service in order to perform the update...
