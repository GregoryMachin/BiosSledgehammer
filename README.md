## About

## Process

When starting BiosSledgehammer.ps1, the following will happen:

* It checks if the environment is ready (64-bit OS, required folders, device is from HP)
* It will try to figure out the password the device is using by going through all files in the [PwdFiles](pwdfilesfolder) folder 

### <a name="pwdfilesfolder">PwdFile folder</a>

The ``\PwdFiles`` folder stores all passowrds BIOS Sledgehammer should try and also the order in which they are processed.

## Using from MDT or SCCM

By default, MDT will run all scripts hidden in order to hide any sensitive information displayed. If you are okay with that, just run ``BiosSledgehammer.ps1`` as PowerShell scripts but remember to tick the box for "Disable 64bit file system redirection" so it is run as 64-bit PowerShell process (this settings is only for SCCM - MDT always runs PowerShell native).

If you want to see what BIOS Sledgehammer is doing, run the provided batch file ``RunVisble.bat`` from MDT with this command line: ``cmd.exe /c "%SCRIPTROOT%\BiosSledgehammer\RunVisible.bat"`` (given you stored it in the *\Scripts* folder). 

This batch automatically uses the correct version of PowerShell, so no box to check for this. It will also set the ``-WaitAtEnd`` parameter which causes BIOS Sledgehammer to pause for 30 seconds when finished so you can have a quick look at the results.

## TODO
* In case BCU returns the code 32769 it can mean two things:
  * This setting can not be set without a BIOS password beeing in place (TPM Activation Policy for example)
  * This setting would result in damage to the current systen (Secure Boot enabled when running this script from Windows 7)
* BIOS passwords need to meet minimum complexity rules. If the password stored in a *.bin file does not meet this rules, the password change will fail. Make sure your password contains uppercase and lowercase letter, together with at least one number.
*  #HPBiosUpdRec64.exe might restart itself as a service in order to perform the update...

* TPM Update: Check Manufacturer ID  
* TPM Update starts if either the TPM SpecVersion **OR** the firmware is below the defined values
* TPM Update: BitLocker for C: and BitLocker module available will cause a full decryption
* Log file are either in C:\Windows\Temp\BiosSledgehammer.ps1.log-XX.txt or in the path your MDT/SCCM defines as ``LogPath`` (typical *C:\MININT\SMSOSD\OSDLOGS* or when it's finished *C:\Windows\Temp\DeploymentLogs\*)
